## ðŸ’» Usage

### **Single CIDR Mode**

```bash
python3 cidr2ip.py
```

* Select **1** when prompted.
* Enter a CIDR (e.g., `202.44.112.0/22`).
* Choose an output directory.
* The tool will generate all usable IPs and save them.

### **Multiple CIDRs from File**

```bash
python3 cidr2ip.py
```

* Select **2** when prompted.
* Provide a file path with CIDRs (one per line).
* Choose an output directory.
* The tool will process all CIDRs in parallel.

Example CIDR file (`cidrs.txt`):

```
202.44.112.0/22
192.168.0.0/24
10.0.0.0/30
